Once you have cloned the repository, please make sure that you have added the 
universal-image-loader-1.6.1-with-src.jar in the libs folder of your project.

This library is responsible for loading the images from the android file system into the Reflect Mobile application as part of the photo gallery feature.

CAUTION - In case the libs folder doesn't show up directly on the project in your IDE ( Eclipse), just refresh it and you should see this jar within the libs folder.
